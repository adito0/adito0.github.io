I am a third year BE(Hons) conjoint BSc Student. I major in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Computer Science and Statistics. Anything related to DataScience and IOT is very exciting to me.

I am a WEN Leader at the University of Auckland, member of the Management and Consultancy Club as well as a social lacrosse player!
